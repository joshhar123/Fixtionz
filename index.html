Consumed by anger and a desire for revenge, Thorfinn joins Askeladd's band of mercenaries and challenges him to duels, hoping to avenge his father. Over time, Thorfinn becomes disillusioned with the cycle of violence and the emptiness of revenge. As the series progresses, Thorfinn begins to question the true meaning of life, searching for a more peaceful path—especially after witnessing the horrors of war and realizing that a life of violence and revenge will only perpetuate suffering. His journey is about reconciling his past actions and finding a purpose beyond bloodshed, ultimately aspiring to live in a peaceful land known as Vinland.";

His most famous duel was with the swordsman Kojiro Sasaki in 1612, where Musashi's unconventional approach secured his victory. As he matured, Musashi shifted from being a fierce warrior to a more introspective philosopher, seeking deeper meaning in his life and martial arts. His later years were spent writing his influential treatise, The Book of Five Rings, which reflects his thoughts on strategy, warfare, and personal growth. Musashi's journey is one of constant self-discovery, mastery of the sword, and the pursuit of inner peace amidst a life of combat and strife.";
